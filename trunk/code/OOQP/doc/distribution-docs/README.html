<P>OOQP - A package for solving convex quadratic programming problems.</P>
This page is part of the <A HREF=../index.html> OOQP documentation </A>.<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>This directory contains OOQP, a package for solving convex quadratic
programming problems (QP). These are optimization problems in which the
objective function is a convex quadratic function and the constraints
are linear functions of a vector of real variables. They have the
following general form:</P>
<PRE>
    minimize (1/2) * x' * Q * x + c' * x
    subject to                     A * x  = b
                                   C * x &gt;= d</PRE>
<P>where Q is a symmetric positive-definite n by n matrix, x is a
n-vector of variables, A and C are matrices of dimensions m_a by n
and m_c by n, respectively, and c, b, and d are vectors of appropriate
dimensions.</P>
<P>Many QPs that arise in practice are highly structured. That is, the
matrices that define them have properties that can be exploited in
designing efficient solution techniques. In addition to the wide
variations in problem structure, there is wide divergence in the ways
in which the problem data and variables for a QP can be stored on a
computer. This distribution of OOQP contains code for the
implementation of solvers for a number of QP formulations, including a
formulation for general QPs in which the Hessian and constraint
matrices are sparse. The code in the distribution also provides a
framework and examples for users who wish to implement solvers that
are tailored to their own specific structured QPs and their specific
computational environments.</P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="getting started">GETTING STARTED</A></H1>
<P>The file <A HREF=".././distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A>, included in this directory, is the
installation guide for the OOQP package.</P>
<P>Further documentation is available in the doc/ directory. For an index
of the available documentation, point your favorite html viewer
(e.g. Netscape) at the file doc/index.html. On many systems, this can
be done by entering a string of the following form into the location
window on the browser:</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="file:/full/path/OOQP/doc/index.html">file:/full/path/OOQP/doc/index.html</A></PRE>
<P>The OOQP Users Guide, which contains a more complete description of
OOQP and its capabilities, can be found at doc/ooqp-userguide.pdf.
This file is in PDF format, which may be read by such programs as
Adobe Acrobat Reader.  If your browser contains a PDF plug-in, you may
simply click on the link ``Users Guide'' from the doc/index.html file to
display the Guide.</P>
<P>Those wishing to use the OOQP framework to develop customized QP
solvers should first read the Users Guide, and then browse through the
reference manual, which is presented as a collection of web pages in
the directory doc/reference_manual, also available as a link from
doc/index.html</P>

<H1><A NAME="problem formulations supported in the ooqp distribution">PROBLEM FORMULATIONS SUPPORTED IN THE OOQP DISTRIBUTION</A></H1>
<P>The OOQP distribution contains a solver for general sparse QPs,
together a number of modules for solving certain structured
QPs. Documentation for these modules can be found in the
doc/formulations directory. The modules are as follows.</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_QpGen">QpGen</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This module solves general convex quadratic programs with sparse
data. This problem is discussed at length in the Users Guide.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_QpBound%7CQpBound"><A HREF=".././formulations/QpBound.html">QpBound</A></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This module solves bound-constrained quadratic programs, in which the
 only constraints are bounds on the variables. The formulation is as
follows.
<PRE>
    minimize   (1/2) * x' * Q * x + c' * x
    subject to                      l &lt;= x &lt;= u</PRE>
<P>See <A HREF=".././formulations/QpBound.html">the QpBound manpage</A> for more information.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Svm%7CSvm"><A HREF=".././formulations/Svm.html">Svm</A></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This module creates a support vector machine classifier for solving
the pattern classification problem in machine learning. See the <A HREF=".././formulations/Svm.html">the Svm manpage</A>
for more information.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Huber%7CHuber"><A HREF=".././formulations/Huber.html">Huber</A></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Solves the Huber regression problem. See <A HREF=".././formulations/Huber.html">the Huber manpage</A>.
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="command line executables">COMMAND LINE EXECUTABLES</A></H1>
<P>The installation process will generate a number of command-line
executables. A typical executable will be named</P>
<PRE>
     formulation-linag-solver.exe</PRE>
<P>Where the strings ``formulation'', ``linalg'' and ``solver'' will be
replaced by appropriate values.  The ``formulation'' string will be one
of the problem formulations given in the preceding section, expressed
in lowercase characters: qpgen, qpbound, svm, or huber. The ``solver''
string indicates the optimization algorithm used to solve the QP. It
will have one of the following values:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_mehrotra">mehrotra</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Mehrotra's predictor-corrector algorithm
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_gondzio">gondzio</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Mehrotra's algorithm with Gondzio's higher-order corrections
<P></P></DL>
<P>The ``linalg'' string is meant to represent how the linear algebra
operations are performed. Typical values are ``sparse'', ``dense'' and
``petsc''. In some cases, the string will more specific, also referring
to the linear solver used to solve linear equations, for instance
``sparse-ma57.'' The linalg string does not appear in the names of the
executables ``svm-gondzio.exe'' and ``huber-gondzio.exe'', for which we
felt it would be redundant. (In these formulations, dense matrices are
used to represent the larger, structured matrices that appear in the
QP formulation.)</P>
<P>Not all combinations of formulations, algorithms, and linear algebra
packages are supported or provided. See the <A HREF=".././distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A> file
for information on how to build all supported executables.  A users
guide for executables based on the QpGen formulation may be found in
doc/ooqp-userguide.pdf. For other executables, see the man page of
their respective formulation in doc/formulations.</P>

<H1><A NAME="use with matlab">USE WITH MATLAB</A></H1>
<P>Some QP solvers supplied with OOQP may be invoked within the Matlab
environment. Installation instructions, in addition to the general
instructions found in <A HREF=".././distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A>, have been supplied in the
<A HREF=".././distribution-docs/README_Matlab.html">README_Matlab</A> file. Once the Matlab interface has
been properly installed, documentation is available from within
Matlab, as described in the README_Matlab file.</P>
<P>
<HR>
