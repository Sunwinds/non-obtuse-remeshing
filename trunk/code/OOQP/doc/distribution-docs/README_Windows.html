<P>README_Windows -- A installation guide for OOQP under Microsoft
Windows</P>
This page is part of the <A HREF=../index.html> OOQP documentation </A>.<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsys">SYNOPSYS</A></H1>
<P>OOQP was developed under an UNIX-like environment, but also may be
installed and will run under Microsoft Windows. The C++ code itself is
platform-independent.  The only issue is the system for building the
libraries and executables.</P>
<P>The file <A HREF=".././distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A> contains instructions for compiling OOQP
in a UNIX-like environment, as well as general information about
installing OOQP. The current file contains suplemental information for
compiling under Windows. You have two supported options. The first is
to install and use Cygwin. The second is to compile under Microsoft
Visual C++.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="cygwin">CYGWIN</A></H1>
<P>Cygwin is a UNIX-like environment that runs under Windows. It is
freely available from <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com,">http://www.cygwin.com,</A> or may be purchased on
machine readable media.  If you choose to install Cygwin, you may
simply follow the standard instructions in the <A HREF=".././distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A>
guide.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="visual c++">Visual C++</A></H1>
<P>The files needed to compile OOQP under Microsoft Visual Studio are not
part of the standard OOQP distribution, but may be obtained from the
OOQP web site <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp.">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp.</A>  Obtain the Visual
Studio support files and extract them as instructed on the web
page. You should now have a VisualStudio subdirectory within the OOQP
directory.</P>
<P>You will also need to obtain the F2C translator and system libraries
for Windows in order to compile MA27. See the <A HREF=".././distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A> file
for a discussion of the F2C and MA27 packages. Once you have obtained
the F2C library, named vcf2c.lib, copy it to the lib subdirectory of
the OOQP directory.</P>
<P>Once you have all the necessary files, open the
OOQP\VisualStudio\OOQP.dsw workspace from within VisualStudio and
build all the projects within it.</P>
<P>We were able to build OOQP on a Windows 2000 machine using Visual
Studio v6.0.</P>
