Please note that you may choose to use either double column or single column
formatting. You may wish to use single column formatting when submitting your
paper for review, as it leaves more space for reviewer remarks. The double column format 
is ideal when submitting your final publication materials. The IEEE CS formats articles
in two columns, with 9.5pt Palatino font, and a page size of 7.875 X 10.75.

Added an option to switch between peer review and final submission formats 
into bare_jrnl.tex.

This IEEEtran.cls is the official LaTeX class for authors of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) transactions
journals and conferences. In addition to being carried on IEEE's site,
IEEEtran.cls may be found at:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/IEEEtran/

The CTAN site may have additional files related to non-IEEE uses of this
tool.

As of version 1.6, IEEEtran.cls now provides support for conferences and
A4 paper. Users of previous versions should no longer manually alter margins,
paper sizes, page styles, etc. Also, please note that \author is used
slightly differently from that of V1.5, especially for conferences.
\pubid (if used) must now be placed before \maketitle. \cite is now robust
and can be used within captions without a proceeding \protect.

As with previous versions, The itemize, enumerate, and description lists as
well as \appendix(ces) have enhanced controls and work slightly differently
than is done in traditional LaTeX.

Extensive formal documentation is now available. Enjoy! ;) The appendices
of the user manual contain important information on avoiding commonly
made mistakes, compatibility issues and installation instructions.


Best wishes for all your publication endeavors,
