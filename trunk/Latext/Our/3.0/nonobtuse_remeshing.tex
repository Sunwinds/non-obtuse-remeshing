Quality meshing is an important problem in geometric modeling, visualization and scientific computing. In this paper, we propose a 3D triangular remeshing method with a \emph{guaranteed} angle bound of $[30^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$. Given a original 2-manifold, open or closed, a rough approximate mesh with the proposed angle bound is first generated. This is achieved by a novel extension of the classical marching cubes algorithm. Next, an iterative constrained optimization, along with constrained Laplacian smoothing, decimation, and subdivision, is performed to arrive at a close approximation of the original mesh.

%Introduction
\section{Introduction}
The most commonly used shape representation is triangular mesh. Efficient rendering, finite element analysis, and geometry processing such as compression, smoothing and deformation benefit form high quality meshes. Thus, a lot remeshing methods have been proposed to improve the mesh quality \cite{AUGA2008}, both in terms of geometry \cite{AVDI2003, ACDLD2003} and connectivity \cite{G2007, AYZ2012}.

In terms of geometry quality, it is desirable for the triangular mesh to have no small angles and/or no larger angles, depending on the targeted applications \cite{S2002}. For example, an essential condition of the accuracy of finite element solutions on triangular meshes is that the angle of any triangle, independent of its size, should not be small. This is called the minimum angle condition. Furthermore, both small and large angles can cause poor condition of the stiffness matrix \cite{S2002}. For some applications, nonobtuse mesh, in which every angle is no larger than $90^{\circ}$, are desirable. Nonobtuse meshes result in more efficient and more accurate geodesic distances computation by fast marching method \cite{KS1998}. Also, nonobtusity ensures the well-known cotangent weights of discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator would be positive \cite{WMKG2007}.

Thus, there have been lots of works on 2D triangulation with angle bounds and remeshing of curved surfaces with angle quality criterion. Chew develops a refinement scheme to ensure an angle bound of $[30^{\circ}, 120^{\circ}]$ based on constrained Delaunay triangulation \cite{C1993}. Bern et al. propose an $O(nlog^{2}n)$ nonobtuse triangulating algorithm \cite{BMR1994}. Cheng and Shi \cite{CS2005} use restricted union of balls to generate an $\varepsilon$-smapling of a surface and extract a mesh form the Delaunay triangulation of the samples points, where a lower angle bound of $30^{\circ}$ can be obtained. A survey on nonobtuse simplicial partitions is given in \cite{JKKS2009}. A novel obtuse triangle suppression method is proposed in \cite{SCWYLL2011} based on centroidal Voronoi tessellation. 

In this paper, we extend our nonobtuse remeshing work \cite{LZ2006} to the angle bound of $[30^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$. Furthermore, our method can preserve the sharp feature during the process of remeshing.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% However, Computer Society journals sometimes do use bottom floats - bear
% this in mind when choosing appropriate optional arguments for the
% figure/table environments.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.
